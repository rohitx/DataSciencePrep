# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Chapter 3: Algorithms Analysis

**Data structure** is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data, and an **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time. The best algorithm is the one that takes least amount of time and space. In order to determine how good an algorithm is, we look at the worst case. The worst case helps us determine the worst case performance of the algorithm. This is safer than evaluating the best case performance as the former helps us decide if we should use it or not. Here's an example of input instance of running an algorithm.

There are seven most important functions used in the analysis of algorithms. We will use only these seven simple functions for almost all the analysis we do in this book.

* **The Constant Function:** The constant function has the following form:


$$f(n) = c$$

for some fixed constant c, such as c = 5, c = 27 and so on.The constant function is useful in algorithm analysis, because it characterizes the number of steps needed to do a basic operation on a computer, like adding two numbers, assigning a value to some variable, or comparing two numbers.

* **The Logarithm Function:** The logarithm function is defined as:


$$x = log_{b}n$$
