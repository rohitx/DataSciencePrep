Curry Leaf has become one of my favorite Indian restaurants in the city, with a fast casual feel but quality food. All of the usual favorites are on the menu, so my boyfriend and I went the safe route and ordered chicken tikka masala and the chicken biryani. The chicken tikka wasn't overly creamy, with just the right amount of flavor and generous with the portion of chicken. We also had the naan, which wasn't the best I've ever had, but it did have the right combination of doughy and chewy that I crave in naan. The chicken biryani is basically an Indian version of fried rice, with onions and spices stir-fried with the basmati rice. They're extremely generous with the chicken in this dish, so it ends up being really filling. The seasoning on everything was spot-on, and I'm definitely going to be back again!
